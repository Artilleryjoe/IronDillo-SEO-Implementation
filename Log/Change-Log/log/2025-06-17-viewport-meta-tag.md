# Viewport Meta Tag Implemented Across Site

**Date**: 2025-06-17  
**Issue**:  
PageSpeed Insights flagged: “No `<meta name='viewport'>` tag found.”  
Without this tag, pages rendered incorrectly on mobile devices, causing layout issues and poor usability — especially in Google's mobile-first indexing context.

**Fix**:  
Added the following tag to the `<head>` section of all static HTML pages:

    ```html
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />

Confirmed presence in index.html, about.html, and all key site pages.

## Why It Matters:
The viewport tag enables proper mobile scaling and rendering, ensuring content adapts to various screen sizes.
This directly impacts mobile usability, Core Web Vitals, and search ranking performance.

## Before/After:

- PageSpeed red triangle warning resolved

- Minor dip in scores (–1) after layout re-evaluation

- Mobile rendering now works as intended

## Tools Used:

PageSpeed Insights (mobile)

Chrome DevTools

Manual inspection via VSCode

## Next Steps:

Incorporate this tag into any layout templates or new pages moving forward

Re-test in Lighthouse after adding more mobile-focused content or navigation
